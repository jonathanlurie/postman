		<description><![CDATA[<p>When I first heard about the 7Artisans 35mm f/1.2 lens, I must admit I was a little bit disappointed that it wasn't a full frame lens. The first images I saw of it looked a little odd too - they certainly didn’t do the design of the lens any favours. I’ve also not been massively overexcited about the CSC lenses 7Artisans produce, with my main interest really being in what they make for M-mount cameras. As such, I’ve found myself all the more surprised with how smitten I am with the 35mmc 1.2 - it’s a crazy little lens, but I can’t help but really like it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Ok, I'm cheating, this isn't 5 frames it's 4. But I only took 4, and they make a nice set... These were taken last summer in a bar in Waterloo at a Beers &#038; Cameras meetup with my Leica M-A and 7Artisans 50mm f/1.1. I was quite drunk, and afterwards forgot I'd shot these. I assume my intention was to push the film, I'm not sure I did. One way or another they came out woefully underexposed. Still, with some careful scanning, and a fairly heavy dose of tweaking in Lightroom I managed to retrieve something of a picture from the very thin Ilford HP5+ negs.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>March 24th 2018 Beers &#38; Cameras is coming to Birmingham I’ve been mulling over bigger meet-up for about 18 months now, but have finally pulled my finger out and decided to get it organised. Working with my good mate and film photographer James, Birmingham resident and FSC photographer Richard P J Lambert, and Robert (LondonCameraProject) who is setting up and kicking off the first Beers &#38; Cameras London early 2018, we have picked the date and begun to make plans for the day. This event is free, open to all photographers. I&#8217;m also trying to bag a couple of sponsors so we can do a couple of give-aways on the day! The Plan (as it stands) We will start the day with a photo-walk across Birmingham. The loose plan is to meet at the train station, walk to new library for the views and architecture. We will then walk along the canals via Brindley Place where we can stop for some lunch. After lunch we will continue to &#8216;The Cube&#8217; (huge modern building), then to new street, maybe the new station, the open air market, China town and then Digbeth for street art. From there we will find an accommodating [&#8230;]</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I honestly don’t remember when or where I first came across the 35mm Holga adapter. The lime-green spacers had been 3D printed by a friend months previous, quickly relegated to the dusty collection of half-finished photo projects I kept on a bedroom shelf. But one summer weekend I got my act together and ran a roll through it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>This piece is all about a photography book that I love: “Helmut Newton- Pages from the glossies“ which focuses on his magazine work from 1956 to 1998. It’s a big book, running to 543 pages, filled with facsimiles of magazine spreads from a number of decades that combine to give a good insight into his style. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I am a contrarian. When I was looking to start again in film photography, I knew immediately that I wanted a vintage Contax G2. My goal was to have a camera that was compact enough for “every day carry,” which meant I was considering primarily rangefinders. Almost anyone who has the least interest in this art form ranks the Leica brand as what they most hope to own, if they rich enough or good enough, or rich enough to suppose they are good enough. My interests have always been iconoclastic. I did not set out to be different for the sake of difference, but for whatever reason my choices usually are not conventional. The Contax G2 is a cult classic in its own right. With proprietary Zeiss lenses, including a 45mm prime said to be ample justification to buy the whole kit, this titanium model still seems contemporary and handsome. The ergonomics are perfect. Everything is in the right place for me. They did not design for obsolescence back in the day. The manufacturer, boasting German origins, bought by Japanese owners, is defunct though, perhaps adding to the appeal. On the internet the prices continue to increase, because adapters allow [&#8230;]</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The biggest issue I have is with the concept of the SLR is the viewfinder. It seems to me that the technology around the SLR viewfinder was flawed from day one, and has now been pretty much superseded by electronic viewfinders. Yet despite this, many people still favour the experience - proven of course by the fact that Nikon and Canon’s top flight cameras are SLRs. I don’t really like the SLR viewfinder, and shooting the Nikon F75 has reminded me of this fact.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes we get pockets of time, and these create adventures, discoveries. On a recent trip to North Carolina, decided to take a detour to a local camera store and see what they had in their “garbage” bins – boxes of as-is film photo gear. I always wanted to do a $100 exercise, walk in and get a full kit and some film for $100 or less, and this was the opportunity. For $55US, I found Pentax Spotmatic with 28mm Kominar lens. It was the focal length of the lens that attracted me to this camera. The weather outside was hot and humid pre-storm weather, so I grabbed two rolls of FP4 and decided to spend about 45 minutes in downtown Raleigh shooting a test roll. Following the lunch at the local pub, I set out into the heat to take photos. Out of the bargain bin, the camera worked. Film was loaded easily, and film advance works quite smoothly. The shooting experience itself was the great. Spotmatic is a relatively large SLR body, definitely heftier than OM-1 or Nikon FE. It feels more substantial to handle, but by no means awkward. Controls and dials are pure efficiency &#8211; very easy [&#8230;]</p>
